Project Overview

This project features a detailed 3D recreation of my personal computer desk setup. The final scene includes three angled computer monitors a wooden desk a desktop PC tower a mechanical keyboard a mouse and a desk mat. Each object was modeled with careful attention to scale lighting and material to create a realistic and cohesive environment.

The design process focused on applying modular and reusable code through the Scene Manager and View Manager structures. Using OpenGL and GLM transformations I implemented precise rotations scaling and positioning to achieve balanced visual depth and natural alignment across all objects.

Technical Highlights

Lighting: Implemented ambient and specular lighting for realism and contrast

Materials: Created glass metal and wood textures to differentiate surfaces

Modeling: Built objects using primitive shapes such as boxes cylinders spheres and planes

Scene Composition: Used GLM transformations to fine tune position and orientation

Performance: Organized rendering functions within modular class structures for clarity and reusability

Reflection

This project strengthened my understanding of 3D rendering pipelines and shader communication. Through iterative testing I learned to balance geometry lighting and texture to create a cohesive visual result. I also gained experience managing complex object hierarchies and debugging graphical output efficiently.

Computational graphics has deepened my problem solving and visualization skills which directly support my professional goals in healthcare IT. The ability to design and interpret complex visual systems is essential for both technical analysis and user experience design.
